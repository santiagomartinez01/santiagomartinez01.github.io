    <p><b>Hello, my name is Santiago Martinez and I am a Senior at Patterson High School. I have been living in Patterson for about 15 years. Before Patterson, I was living in Tracy with both my parents, Santiago and Graciela Martinez, along with my sister, Maira Lizbeth Martinez. At the age of two, my parents decided to move to Patterson because it was safer that Tracy at the time and also to be closer to my paternal grandmother. I'd like to tell about how it was moving here but I would have zero clue. For fun, in my spare time I like to listen to music, go on walks alone, and it may sound crazy but I also like to organize. I don't really know why actually. Normally, seeing things that don't look aesthetically neat bothers me. Meaning, if you ever see me, I will almost most likely have one of the cleanest backpacks, neat and organized, than most teenagers. Life is crazy, so having ambitious can be such as crazy and also conquering them. In the future, I have high hopes and determination to attend a four-year university and earn a Bachelor's Degree in either Registered Nursing or Spanish. Once that it done, I do plan to go for my Master's Degree as soon as possible. Reason being, that with a Masters in Registered Nursing, it would allow me to have leverage over other nurses and also to earn a bit more money. As for if I choose Spanish, it is to be a professor at a Junior College. If I do decide on Spanish, I'd eventually go back to school and attempt to earn my Ph.D to be able to teach at the university level. Apart from my studies, I'd like to also open up a restaurant with my sister called "Casa Green" in memory of this one green house that we had lived in for about 11 years. This will be a Mexican restaurant and will be family owned. My sister will have her Business Administration with Ã©nfasis in Accounting Degree by the time we open the restaurant and I'd have my Spanish Degree to be able to help with proper grammar in menus, signs, promotions, etc. Well there it is, my life here and later in a small flash. 
Thank you for reading,
Santiago Martinez </p></b>
